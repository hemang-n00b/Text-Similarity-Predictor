# Directory structure:

1. <b>Part (a) -  Task 1 </b>

cbow.ipynb and plot.ipynb were used for this task. cbow.ipynb involves training a neural network model and it's weights were saved in model_weights.h5.

2. <b>Part (a) - Task 2 </b>

glove.ipynb was used in this part. The GloVe model was trained in the GloVe directory and it's embeddings were stored in vector.txt

3. <b> Part (b) - Task 1 and Task 2 </b>

phrase.ipynb and sentence.ipynb were used for Phrase and Sentence similarity. Note that Sentence similarity model takes time to train.

4. <b> Part (c) - Task 1 </b>

transformer.ipynb was used for this. BERT transformer was loaded in this from the internet.

5. <b> Report </b> - Report summarizing the entire task
